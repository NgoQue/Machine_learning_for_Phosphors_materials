# 📊 Data Processing and Machine Learning Models for Phosphor Prediction & Inverse Design

This repository provides a **reproducible data processing pipeline and machine learning framework** for **composition-based prediction and inverse design of doped phosphor materials**.

The workflow is intentionally **structure-free**, relying **only on elemental composition**, making it well-suited for sparse experimental datasets collected from the literature.
